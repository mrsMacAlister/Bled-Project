        <strong>Bled</strong> (German: Veldes, in older sources also Feldes) is
        a town on Lake Bled in the Upper Carniolan region of northwestern
        Slovenia. It is the administrative seat of the Municipality of Bled. It
        is most notable as a popular tourist destination in the Upper Carniola
        region and in Slovenia as whole, attracting visitors from abroad too.
      </p>
      <p>
        The town was first attested in written sources as Ueldes in 1004 (and as
        Veldes in 1011). The etymology of the name is unknown and it is believed
        to be of pre-Slavic origin. The German name of the town, Veldes, was
        either borrowed from Old Slovene *Beldъ before AD 800 or is derived from
        the same pre-Slavic source as the Slovene name.
      </p>
      <h2>Early Medieval History</h2>
      <p>
        A settlement area since Mesolithic times, the present-day locality
        probably arose about 600 during the Slavic settlement of the Eastern
        Alps. After the Slavic principality of Carantania was conquered by
        Frankish forces in 788, the area came under Bavarian influence.
      </p>

      <h2>Feudal estate</h2>
      <p>
        German King Henry II ceded ownership of the area in 1004 to Albuin,
        Bishop of Brixen as a sign of gratitude for the assistance the Church
        was giving to the king in his attempt to strengthen imperial rule in
        that part of northern Italy. In 1011, Henry II signed another deed of
        donation that added the castle and an area of land the size of thirty
        king's farms. That area, between the Sava Bohinjka and the Sava Dolinka,
        became known as the Lordship of Veldes (German: Herrschaft Veldes).
        These donations marked a turning point in the history of Bled and, for
        the following 800 years, the area remained under the sovereignty of the
        prince-bishops of Brixen.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bishops very seldom visited their remote possession 300 km away.
        Initially, the lordship was administered by ministeriales (bonded
        knights), castellans, and castle staff in accordance with feudal
        practices, but in the middle of the 14th century the prince-bishops
        decided instead to lease the estate. Under one of the 16th-century
        lessees, Bled Castle became a Protestant stronghold for a time. When the
        leasehold era came to an end, the prince-bishops began to appoint
        governors to manage their distant lordship. Until the middle of the 18th
        century, those administrators were exclusively aristocratic, but later
        they included non-nobles.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1803, Brixen's rule came to an end when the prince-bishopric was
        secularized in the course of the German Mediatization. Bled then came
        under Austrian sovereignty but in 1808, along with Carniola, it was
        included in the Napoleonic Illyrian Provinces. It returned under
        Austrian sovereignty in 1813, and in 1838 the Austrian Emperor returned
        Bled to the bishops of Brixen as a private estate. With the abolition of
        the feudal system in 1848, Bled ceased to have the characteristics of a
        feudal economy and from then on it experienced several changes in
        ownership, including industrialists and a bank.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918, Bled and the rest of
        Carniola came under the rule of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and became a
        summer domicile of the ruling House of Karađorđević, a tradition that
        Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito continued when he built his residence
        here in 1947.
      </p>
      <h2>Modern Settlement</h2>
      <p>
        Today's town began to form in the mid-19th century from the villages of
        Grad, Mlino, Rečica, Zagorice, and Želeče, which were encircling the
        lake. At that time, farmers started to sell the land along the eastern
        lakeshore to wealthy individuals for their villas, and the villages of
        Grad, Zagorice, and Želeče began to merge. Bled was officially
        recognised as a town in 1960.
